A Comparison of Movie Recommendation Engines

Abstract

The ever-increasing volume of information across the web has rendered the need for consumers to filter through options, to make informed decisions. This hold true in media, as the ease of selection can generate more views, purchases and revenue. The movie industry has seen a substantial increase of revenue due to the avid use of recommendation systems.
Recommendation systems are algorithms that make product or service recommendations to customers by narrowing down their search and presenting them with suggestions that they are likely to consume. One of the most popular recommendation systems is the collaborative system. The collaborative system can either use the behavior of the user to make recommendations by suggesting products that similar users like (user-based collaborative filtering) or by identifying items based on the userâ€™s preferences (item-based collaborative filtering).
This Capstone project will focus on creating various recommendation systems using the MovieLens 100K dataset, which contains 100,000 rows and 38 attributes (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). Matrices would be created and incorporated with similarity measures and algorithms such as Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity, and KNN to ensure profitable movie recommendations to consumers.
